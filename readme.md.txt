This project contains a suite of animation demos/tools.

This includes matrix operations, Euler angles and quaternions, BVH, forward and inverse kinematics (limb IK, CCD, pseudoinverse), particle simulation, and behavioral animation (flocking, avoid, etc.).

The project defaults to launching the Behavior Viewer tool.  To see other demos, simply change the startup project to one of the other viewers.
